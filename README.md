# TIC-TAC-TOE

This code was made in order to practice the main concepts of the C language (aimed at data structure) such as: pointers, structs and dynamic data allocation. 

## HOW TO USE

* Compile the code by yourself (pay attention to the rules for compiling and integrating files).
* Using the `Makefile` available. In this case, use the command: `make`.

## ATTENTION

* Make sure the 'make' command works on your computer.
    
* In singleplayer mode you will play against a simple bot - he has no vision of the game, other than making random moves :)
  * Feel free to improve it! 
* Feel free to use the code and change it as you wish.
